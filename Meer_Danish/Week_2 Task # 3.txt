what is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage 
and manipulate data stored in relational databases. 
SQL is used to create, modify, and retrieve data from databases. 
Here is a simple example of SQL query:

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 25;

This query selects all the columns from the customers table where the age is greater than 25.
The * is a wildcard that selects all columns, and WHERE is a clause that filters 
the results based on a specified condition.

SQL is widely used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, education,
and e-commerce to manage and organize data efficiently.
